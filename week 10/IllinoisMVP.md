# MVP: Illinois Flight Delays
Minimal viable product for flight delays classification model

---

## Goal Setting and Success Metrics

- **Goal**: to create an MVP for classifying flight delays in Illinois in years 2023, 2020, 2018, and 2014
- **Success Metric**: Precision (ratio of corretly predicted delays to the total predicted delays), Recall (ratio of correctly predicted delays to all actual delays), or F1 Score (combines precision and recall)

---
## Data Cleaning

- **Missing values**:
  
- **Categorical variables**:
  
- **Class balancing**:

---
## Data Exploration

- Visualizations of class balance, correlations, etc

---
## Baseline Model

- Logistic Regression

---
## Model Selection and Training

- **70/20/10 split**
- Other models such as Random Forest, etc

---
## Evaluation

- **Confusion matrices**
- **Classification Report**
- **Baseline comparison**
- **Success metrics**

---
## Key Findings
