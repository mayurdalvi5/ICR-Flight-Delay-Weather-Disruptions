# Report 1
## Due October 16th

  - **Intro**
    - Describe the problem context, including any required domain knowledge or terminology. When written well, introductions narrate a story that culminates in an obvious problem to be solved. The reader need not be an expert in the domain, but they must have enough information to understand the problem and its consequences. End the introduction by explicitly stating the research question and the benefits of answering it.
      
  - **Sources**
    - Explain the relevance and reliability of the project's source materials. The source review should include both data and research materials. Depending on the study type, data might be obtained directly via experimentation or indirectly via observation. In either case, you must defend the quality of your data and summarize its structure. Similarly, past research related to the problem at hand may be of varying quality. Prior to leveraging past results or employing domain-specific knowledge, you must ensure its veracity. Often this is a matter of confirming information with multiple sources.

# Report 2
## Due November 13th

  - **Intro** and **Sources**
    
  - **Methodology**
    - Explain the analytic methodology your project will employ. Will it be exploratory, inferential, predictive, or some combination? Why is this methodology well-suited for the research question? Which particular statistical modeling approach(es) will you use? Will it be regression or classification, supervised or unsupervised, parametric or non-parametric? Why do you believe this approach is appropriate for the problem at hand? The methodology section is a justification of the analytic approach your team intends to leverage for your specific research question.
      
  - **Exploration**
    - Present the key insights drawn from a broad exploration of the distributions, associations, and trends within the data, including graphics where appropriate. This is the opportunity for your team to reveal important discoveries that impact the subsequent analysis and results of the project. Do the distributions of certain variables limit the analytic methods employed? Are there potential associations between variables that should be tested in an inferential analysis? Are there dramatic differences in the explanatory capacity of certain variables that should be investigated in a predictive analysis? Depending on the selected methodology, questions such as these must be answered.
   
  - **Results**
    - Highlight preliminary results based on executing the selected methodology. In this case, "preliminary" simply means your team has not yet exhausted all of the available techniques that could improve your results. It also means your team has not presented the results to the domain expert and incorporated contextual considerations that could impact real-world implementation. Your discussion of the preliminary results should speak to the potential for the selected methodology to actually answer the research question. Ideally, the potential is positive. However, we sometimes discover that a particular approach is not well-suited to our problem and we need to pivot. Don't be discouraged! This is a normal part of real-world analysis. At this point in the project, you have time to adjust and pursue other methods.

# Final Slides
## Due December 6th

  - Submit final slideshow for presentation

---

# Presentation
## Takes place either on December 10th or 12th

  - Present the team's completed project to your classmates, domain expert, and department faculty in person and via teleconference. You must provide your domain expert a copy of your slides at least 24 hours prior to the meeting. Your presentation cannot exceed 20 minutes, including questions. Although it is permissible for one team representative to lead the presentation, all team members should have a speaking role and be prepared to answer questions. In fact, each team member will be asked at least one question during or after the presentation

# Report 3
## Due December 15th

  - The final report on your project must incorporate all of the feedback and recommendations from previous versions. The new additions to the report should include an abstract, summarize the final analytic results, discuss the significance and limitations of those results in the context of the problem, conclude with an answer to the research question, make recommendations for implementation and future work, and properly cite all references. Your paper should be a stand-alone product that is well-organized, consistently formatted, clearly explained, and peer-reviewed for spelling and grammar. In short, it should be publication-ready whether your team intends to seek publication or not.
    
  - Include all previous sections. New sections include:
    
    - **Discussion**
      - Interpret the results of your analysis in the context of the problem. Use the language of your domain and present insights in a manner appropriate for a non-statistical audience. How can someone who works in the domain benefit from your results? What are the ethical considerations for the use of your model? Under what circumstances should it not be used? Why do these limitations exist? This section is your team's opportunity to translate the analytic results into terms specifically tailored to the domain
        
    - **Conclusions**
      - Answer the research question! Just as you ended the Introduction by explicitly stating the research question, you should open the Conclusions by plainly announcing its answer. Good answers are directly aligned with the original question and actionable within the domain. This section is also the place to recommend implementation strategies for your model. How might the domain expert actually use your work to achieve a competitive advantage? Does future work remain to gain an even greater advantage? What data or analysis is required for that future work? Well-written conclusions provide a satisfying end to the story that began in the Introduction.
     
    - **References**
