    - Are we interested in arrival delays in addition to departure delays?
    - Any thoughts on our year-wise data?

# Next Week's Goals

  - **All team members** will be making an account with CU Boulder's super computer in order to work with the 11 years worth of data in its entirety rather than year-wise.
