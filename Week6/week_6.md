# Blockers and Questions
  
  - **Data collection and cleaning**
      - Should we include all delayed flights in our dataset (including delays not caused by adverse weather)? If so, should we do a binary categorization: delays due to weather (1) and everything else (0)
      - Delays due to weather make up a small percentage of our data. Should we consider weather delays to be a rare occurrence and conduct our data analysis accordingly, or should we reduce the non-weather delay data so that it's a 50/50 split?
      -  We can only find weather data by the hour. How should we interpolate the weather that occured between each hour? Ideally, we'd like to have weather data in 15 minute intervals.

# Next Week's Goals

- **Ella** will be conducting a literature review on weather data interpolation for hourly intervals
- After receiving feedback from the ICR team regarding our blockers, **Mayur** will be cleaning the data accordingly, downloading data from other states, and merging the flight/weather data
- **Reza** will finish our source section after Mayur has completed the dataset
